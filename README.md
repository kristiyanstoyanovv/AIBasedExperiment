Java based application, implemented using AI genetic algorithm.
The idea is that we have a chessboard (8x8 or more), for each row queen,
so for example if we have 8x8 board, we will have 8 queens placed somewhere on it.
The problem that the application need to solve is to place each queen somewhere
on the board without attacking any other queen. The problem is solved using
principle AI genetic algorithm.
